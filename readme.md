<!-- description -->

Divolt is a self-hosted instance of Revolt - a user-first, privacy-friendly chat platform built with modern web technologies.
  
This list is a fork of [awesome-revolt](https://github.com/insertish/awesome-revolt) for stuff that's compatible with it.

```
PSA

On the July 13th, Divolt's internal database had to be reverted back to an old backup (about a month old) which means 
the majority of data has been lost. If you can't login, you'll probably have to settle with a new account.

If the page won't load at all, try disabling your adblocker or using incognito.
